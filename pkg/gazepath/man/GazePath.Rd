Transform Raw Eye-Tracking Data into Fixations and Saccades
}
\description{
This function transforms raw eye-tracking data into fixations and saccades using a non-parametric speed-based approach to do this on a trial basis. The method is especially useful when there are large differences in data quality between or within participants. Lower data quality results in more conservative thresholds, thereby controlling for noise levels.

  \item{method}{
Must be one of the following methods: Mould, MouldDur, Mould.all, Mould.allDur, gazepath, Tobii, Eyelink.

Mould estimates velocity threshold per trial and duration thresholds per person (recommended for high, > 250 Hz, samplerate and high quality data)

MouldDur estimates velocity threshold per trial and uses the duration thresholds specified under 'thres_dur' (recommended for low, < 250 Hz, samplerate data and data of low quality)

Mould.all estimates velocity threshold and duration threshold for all trials (recommended for high, > 250 Hz, samplerate data and data with short trial times, < 2 seconds)

Mould.allDur estimates one velocity threshold for all trials and uses the duration threshold specified under 'thres_dur' (recommended for high, > 250 Hz, samplerate data and data with short trial times, < 2 seconds and few trials)

gazepath estimates velocity thresholds per person and uses the duration thresholds specified under 'thres_dur'. Furthermore, extra preprocessing steps are performed, such as, last point interpolation of missing data sequences of length in_thres and combining succesive fixations that overlap in space.

Tobii derives fixations and saccades based on the algorithm described in the ClearView 2.7 manual

Eyelink classifies saccades as sequences of samples (> 4ms) that have a velocity over 35 deg/s, acceleration over 8000 deg/s^2 and defliction over 0.1 deg of visual angle. Fixations are the sequences of samples that are not saccades and pass the duration threshold of 100 ms
}
  \item{posthoc}{
TRUE or FALSE (default). When TRUE successive fixations close in space are merged.
}
  \item{thres_vel}{
The desired velocity threshold, will only be used for method 'Eyelink'
}
  \item{thres_dur}{
The desired duration threshold, will be used for methods 'gazepath', 'Eyelink' and 'MouldDur' 
}
  \item{min_dist}{
The minimal distance from the screen in mm, samples below this distance are considered unreliable and are omitted from further analysis.
}

  \item{trial_index}{
  Argument of the plot function, refering to the trial to be plotted
  }
  \item{complete_only}{
  Argument (TRUE/FALSE) to indicate whether only fixations that have incoming out outgoing saccades and saccades that are between two fixations should be selected
  }
  \item{fixations_only}{
